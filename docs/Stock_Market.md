FIX Protocol

| here represents the SOH (0x01) separator in actual messages.

Important tags for us:

35 â†’ MsgType (8=Execution Report, D=New Order)
55 â†’ Symbol (AAPL, MSFT)
44 â†’ Price
38 â†’ Quantity
52 â†’ SendingTime (timestamp)


Deep FIX/ITCH/SBE parsing

Right now youâ€™re logging raw messages.
Next: parse them into structured fields (symbol, price, size, side, message type, timestamp, etc.).
That way you can feed them into dashboards / alerting systems.

Protocol-specific traffic patterns

Example: detect spikes in ITCH quotes, FIX order cancels, SBE trades.
Implement counters + rate thresholds.
Useful for real-time monitoring / anomaly detection.

Unified Market Data Layer

Convert FIX / ITCH / SBE into a common struct (MarketEvent { protocol, msg_type, symbol, price, qty, ts }).
Then the rest of the system works protocol-agnostic.

Performance hooks

Measure latency per protocol parser.
Detect malformed messages.
Drop counters.

Anomaly Detection 

Phase 1 â€” Rule-based detection (baseline)

Why: Simple, deterministic, easy to debug.

How:

Track per-symbol inter-arrival times (FIX/ITCH/SBE).

Raise alert if inter-arrival > threshold â†’ delay/missing feed.

Track messages/sec per symbol. If sudden jump >> moving average â†’ burst.

Track protocol coverage (if FIX alive but ITCH quiet â†’ feed outage).

This gives you a reliable baseline without AI/ML.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 â€” Statistical anomaly detection

Introduce adaptive thresholds:

Moving averages, standard deviation bands (e.g. >3Ïƒ).

Percentile-based (p95/p99) latency vs current sample.

This helps adapt to different load conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 â€” AI/ML layer

Once youâ€™ve got baseline + metrics collection, you can plug in ML. Options:

Unsupervised anomaly detection (no labels needed):

Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF (local outlier factor).

Input features: packets/sec, latency distribution, per-symbol update gaps.

Time-series models:

LSTM/GRU, Prophet, ARIMA.

Learn normal traffic patterns, flag deviations.

Real-time streaming AI:

Use something like PyTorch/ONNX integrated with your C/DPDK pipeline.

Stream features â†’ inference â†’ anomaly score.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4 â€” Dashboard integration

Add an Alerts Panel:

Show rule-based alerts (missing feed, burst, delay).

Show ML anomaly scores (e.g. heatmap / anomaly index).

Eventually: build a feedback loop to label & retrain ML.
